\chapter{About this document}
\section{Purpose}

This document serves as a playground to test and re-learn\footnotemark{} \LaTeX{} and its features.
\footnotetext{After about 15 years of not touching it at all}
Here I'm trying some footnotes with \verb=\footnote=, \verb=\footnotemark=
\footnote{sets the superscript mark number of a footnote separately from the text}
and \verb=\footnotetext=\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{sets the text of the footnote}

\section{Previously}

I used to write laboratory protocols in \LaTeX{} when I was studying chemistry.

I would have lost my mind if I had tried to wrote those in MS Word or OpenOffice.
