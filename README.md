# Esther's LaTeX Templates

These are just a bunch of LaTeX templates I intend to use for my own writing.

Feel free to use them too. They are far from "done" though by any definition, so don't expect a well maintained thing here.

I'll expand these as I go, hopefully zeroing in on something actually usable.

## Building the templates

The templates share some code and to compile them run:

```
ruby compile-templates.rb
```

This is only necessary if you have made any changes to `common/base.tex`.

Remember to not make changes to the "base-directives" section in each template as those are overwritten by this script.
